## Background

I download mp3 from Thiraipaadal, and my choice of songs are generally picky. I suddenly remember a song and then I want to listen it. Youtube audio quality sucks. I had to search for a song, find it in Thiraipaadal, inspect the http request and download it.

I wanted it to be more easy. Like search in commandline and download right there. That is why I built this.


## Install

I've been using this in OS X, I am not sure how it works in other systems. It should work well in Ubuntu.

### Install

Requires [rvm](http://beginrescueend.com/rvm/install/), I'm using ruby-1.9.2-p290 (via .rvmrc). Once you have ruby and rvm,

    bundle install
    
This will install all the required gems. 


### Searching and Downloading

Once installed, you can search and download mp3s by song name

    ruby download.rb nilave
    
It also supports multi strings. You don't have to add quotes. It understands.

    ruby download.rb munbe va

This was a post-dinner hack. I find myself listening to Ilayaraja songs. 

And yes, I did miss the New Year Ilayaraja concert.
